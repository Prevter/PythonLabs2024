Like all regular hypercubic honeycombs, the tesseractic honeycomb corresponds to a sphere packing of edge-length-diameter spheres centered on each vertex, or (dually) inscribed in each cell instead. In the hypercubic honeycomb of 4 dimensions, vertex-centered 3-spheres and cell-inscribed 3-spheres will both fit at once, forming the unique regular body-centered cubic lattice of equal-sized spheres (in any number of dimensions). Since the tesseract is radially equilateral, there is exactly enough space in the hole between the 16 vertex-centered 3-spheres for another edge-length-diameter 3-sphere. (This 4-dimensional body centered cubic lattice is actually the union of two tesseractic honeycombs, in dual positions.)

This is the same densest known regular 3-sphere packing, with kissing number 24, that is also seen in the other two regular tessellations of 4-space, the 16-cell honeycomb and the 24-cell-honeycomb. Each tesseract-inscribed 3-sphere kisses a surrounding shell of 24 3-spheres, 16 at the vertices of the tesseract and 8 inscribed in the adjacent tesseracts. These 24 kissing points are the vertices of a 24-cell of radius (and edge length) 1/2.
